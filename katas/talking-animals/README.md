# 🦁 Talking Animals! 🐯

We are building a zoo inside a computer. Each animal species in our zoo has lots
of different, particular, behaviors, but all animals talk to each other in a similar
way. Specifically, they all implement a speak method, the output of which is the
arbitrary input string interspersed with an "animal sound" that is particular to that
type of animal.

## Examples: 

> lion.speak( "I'm a lion" ); // Output: "I'm roar a roar lion roar"
> dog.speak("Hello I'm a dog"); // Output: "Hello woof I'm woof a woof dog woof"
